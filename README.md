# Water-Quality-Prediction-Model
A water quality prediction machine learning model is a valuable tool that utilizes data-driven techniques to forecast the quality of water in various contexts, such as bodies of water, reservoirs, drinking water systems, or industrial processes. By analyzing historical data and relevant features, these models can provide insights into water quality parameters and help inform decision-making processes related to resource management, public health, and environmental preservation.
